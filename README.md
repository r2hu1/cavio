# Slate (In Development)

**Slate** was initially intended to be a closed-source project, but I figured‚Äîwhy not open-source it? That way, others can learn, contribute, or build on top of it.

It's a **Notion-like note-taking app**, but not just for notes‚ÄîSlate is designed for **content writing, script drafting, blogging, journaling**, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Locally

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project** *(skip if you already have one)*
2. **Create an OAuth client** in Google Cloud
3. **Create a GitHub App**

Once done, copy the values into your local `.env` file:

* Use `.env.example` as a reference
* Rename it to `.env` and fill in the required variables

## üìù Self deploy

For self-hosting, there's a dedicated branch where I've removed all payment integrations (Stripe/Polar) so you can access all features without restrictions.
