# Slate (In Development)

```**Slate** was initially intended to be a closed-source project, but I figured‚Äîwhy not open-source it? That way, others can learn, contribute, or build on top of it.```

It's a **Notion-like note-taking app**, but not just for notes‚ÄîSlate is designed for **content writing, script drafting, blogging, journaling**, and more.

## üöÄ Features

Initially, I thought‚Äîwhy not build something inspired by Notion, rather than replicating it entirely? So while some features may feel familiar, the goal isn't to make a one-to-one copy.
